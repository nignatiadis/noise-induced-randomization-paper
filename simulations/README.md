# Code for simulation study (Section 7) with Binomial Running Variable

* `simulation.R`: Main file implementing the simulations in R. It calls upon the Noise-Induced Randomization implementation on the Julia package [RegressionDiscontinuity.jl](https://github.com/nignatiadis/RegressionDiscontinuity.jl) through the [JuliaCall](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuliaCall/index.html) package. It also calls upon the [optrdd](https://github.com/swager/optrdd) and [rdrobust](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdrobust/index.html) R packages. In total, we consider 24 simulation settings. The i-th simulation results can be generated by running `Rscript simulation.R i`.
* `summarize_simulations.R`: This file takes as input the results of running `simulation.R` and summarizes the results as tables.
